# About

Hey,

I'm a Computer Science Engineer with a career in Data Privacy. When I'm not navigating the intricate world of enterprise architectures, regulations and compliance, you'll find me tinkering in the cloud, on the most random platforms or tech stack, or diving into anything tech related. Like a jack of all trades, maybe master of none. Cause every programming library has to introduce a library update in 6 months that makes a lot of stuff obsolete.(Except you COBOL, you're good)

As an AI language model, I have been trained.....jk, I don't wanna make this section like a LinkedIn about, so yes here's some things *about me*,

 - I game. Grinding [Space Marine 2](https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2) at the moment and Forza always on the side, Story based games like Life is Strange have a special place in my heart.
 - I love cameras. 360 cameras are dope especially for reframing your PoV after you're done shooting. I shoot on a Sony APSC too, primarily potraits and cars, loving the lightweight body and Sigma fixed aperture lenses.
 - [I drive, hehe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D28ntCyODmE). My petrolhead bros made me fall in love with cars.
 - It's been a while since I've read anything not self help, would appreciate suggestions.
 - [Odesza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odesza) is my all time favourite duo. I could listen to all their albums on repeat forever. Hope I'll catch them live some day!
 - I take my time with travel. I want to see as much as I can, spend as much time understanding what I'm looking at on trips.

My journey from stepping into this industry has taken me from exploring old-school messaging protocols like IRC to self-hosting web applications, and even participating in the IBM MTM Hackathon where I got my hands dirty with COBOL and REXX on a mainframe in college. Lately, I've been captivated by the potential of LLMs. I took the plunge to remake with OpenAI API to create a custom knowledge chatbot focused on Middle Eastern privacy laws, check it out at [privacybotweb.shanen.works](https://shanen.works/flask/)! 

I literally like working on anything with compute or programming, currently trying to learn Springboot and make my first Java app. AI Agentic era is making me every so lazy.

So yeah that's me, Feel free to explore the site, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat about data privacy, technology, or just about anything else!
